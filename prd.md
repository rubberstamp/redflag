# Product Requirements Document: QuickBooks Red Flag Detector

## Overview
A lightweight Rails application that enables users to quickly authenticate with QuickBooks, scan their financial data for anomalies using AI analysis, generate a comprehensive report, and securely log out. The focus is on a quick, secure session that identifies potential waste, fraud, and abuse in financial transactions.

## Problem Statement
Business owners and financial teams need an efficient way to audit QuickBooks data for suspicious transactions without extensive manual review. Current solutions are either too complex, expensive, or require significant technical expertise.

## User Flow
1. User visits site and authenticates with QuickBooks via OAuth
2. System pulls relevant financial data
3. AI-powered analysis engine identifies potential red flags
4. Report is generated and displayed with risk scores
5. User reviews findings and can export report
6. User logs out, with no data retained locally

## Technical Requirements
1. Built on Ruby on Rails
2. QuickBooks API integration using official gems
3. Integration with AI/ML APIs for transaction analysis
4. Stateless design - no data stored between sessions
5. Responsive design for all devices
6. Exportable reports (PDF, CSV)
7. Secure handling of financial data with proper encryption
8. Inline Tailwind CSS for all styling

## AI Analysis Capabilities
1. Pattern recognition to identify anomalies in transaction history
2. Risk scoring for each detected anomaly
3. Contextual analysis of transaction descriptions
4. Vendor reputation assessment
5. Trend analysis across time periods
6. Behavioral analysis of spending patterns
7. Natural language processing of transaction notes and descriptions

## Red Flag Detection Rules
- Unusual spending patterns (statistical outliers)
- Duplicate transactions (same amount, close dates)
- Round number transactions (potential manual entries)
- Unexpected vendor payments (new or infrequent vendors)
- Transactions outside business hours
- Mismatched invoice/payment amounts
- High-frequency small transactions (potential splitting)
- Unauthorized category spending
- Anomalous transaction sequences
- Suspicious timing patterns (end of month, quarter, year)

## Success Metrics
1. User adoption rate
2. Average session duration under 5 minutes
3. Percentage of flagged transactions that warrant further investigation
4. User satisfaction with report accuracy
5. AI detection accuracy rate
6. False positive reduction rate

## Future Enhancements
- Custom rule configuration
- Scheduled automated scans
- Integration with other accounting platforms
- Advanced AI model training with user feedback
- Multi-user access with role-based permissions
- Predictive analytics for future spending anomalies
- Industry-specific analysis models
- Automated remediation recommendations
- Integration with governance and compliance frameworks
