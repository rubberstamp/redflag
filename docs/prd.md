# Product Requirements Document: QuickBooks Red Flag Detector

## Overview
A lightweight Rails application that enables users to quickly import financial data (either through QuickBooks authentication or CSV upload), scan it for anomalies using AI analysis, generate a comprehensive report, and securely log out. The focus is on a quick, secure session that identifies potential waste, fraud, and abuse in financial transactions, with flexible data input options.

## Problem Statement
Business owners and financial teams need an efficient way to audit QuickBooks data for suspicious transactions without extensive manual review. Current solutions are either too complex, expensive, or require significant technical expertise.

## User Flow
1. User visits site and provides email address
2. User either:
   - Authenticates with QuickBooks via OAuth
   - Uploads a CSV file with transaction data
3. System imports relevant financial data
4. AI-powered analysis engine identifies potential red flags
5. System shows preview of key findings to demonstrate value
6. Lead capture form collects additional information (name, phone number, company size) required to access full report
7. Based on analysis severity, user is presented with personalized options to:
   - Schedule a call with a fractional CFO for detailed report analysis
   - Skip consultation and proceed directly to the report
8. Complete report is generated and displayed with risk scores
9. User reviews findings
10. User logs out, with no data retained locally

## Technical Requirements
1. Built on Ruby on Rails
2. QuickBooks API integration using official gems
3. CSV import functionality for transaction data
4. Integration with AI/ML APIs for transaction analysis
5. Stateless design - no data stored between sessions
6. Responsive design for all devices
7. Secure handling of financial data with proper encryption
8. Inline Tailwind CSS for all styling
9. CSV mapping interface for custom file formats

## AI Analysis Capabilities
1. Pattern recognition to identify anomalies in transaction history
2. Risk scoring for each detected anomaly
3. Contextual analysis of transaction descriptions
4. Vendor reputation assessment
5. Trend analysis across time periods
6. Behavioral analysis of spending patterns
7. Natural language processing of transaction notes and descriptions
8. Cash flow cycle analysis to identify liquidity risks
9. Accounts receivable/payable turnover ratio assessment

## Red Flag Detection Rules
- Unusual spending patterns (statistical outliers)
- Duplicate transactions (same amount, close dates)
- Round number transactions (potential manual entries)
- Unexpected vendor payments (new or infrequent vendors)
- Transactions outside business hours
- Mismatched invoice/payment amounts
- High-frequency small transactions (potential splitting)
- Unauthorized category spending
- Anomalous transaction sequences
- Suspicious timing patterns (end of month, quarter, year)
- Uncategorized items/transactions (which can delay month-end processes)
- Cash cycle anomalies (indicating potential cash flow issues)
- Extended accounts receivable aging (impacting cash management)

## Success Metrics
1. User adoption rate
2. Average session duration under 5 minutes
3. Percentage of flagged transactions that warrant further investigation
4. User satisfaction with report accuracy
5. AI detection accuracy rate
6. False positive reduction rate
7. CSV import success rate
8. User satisfaction with CSV import experience
9. Lead capture conversion rate
10. CFO consultation booking rate
11. Lead-to-customer conversion rate
12. Report delivery open rate
13. Lead quality score based on company size and engagement

## Lead Capture and CFO Consultation Phase
1. **Progressive Lead Information Collection**
   - Collect minimal information (email only) before beginning analysis process
   - Gather additional details (name, phone number, company size) after analysis is complete
   - Clearly inform users this information is needed to deliver their report
   - Implement micro-commitments between analysis and full lead capture to increase conversion
   - Validate inputs for proper formatting and completeness
   - Store lead information securely in compliance with privacy regulations

2. **Personalized CFO Consultation Options**
   - Present users with consultation options based on analysis severity and detected issues
   - Customize consultation recommendations according to risk level identified
   - Embed a scheduling tool to select appointment times
   - Allow users to skip booking and proceed directly to their report
   - Provide brief explanation of the value a CFO can add in analyzing their report

3. **Micro-Commitment Funnel Design**
   - Implement small, progressive steps between analysis completion and full lead capture
   - Show limited preview of key findings to demonstrate value before requesting additional information
   - Use psychological commitment principles to increase form completion rates
   - Provide clear progress indicators showing steps completed and remaining

4. **Technical Implementation**
   - Form validation with client and server-side checks
   - Integration with scheduling software for CFO appointments
   - Lead data storage with proper encryption
   - Email notification system for both user and internal team
   - Analytics tracking of conversion rates and booking rates
